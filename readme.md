I just tried using the python turtle to make the sierpinski triangle where you make three dots of a triangle and then randomly choose a point inside of the triangles plain and then choosing a vertice randomly and then start pointing the middle of those two point and when you repeadly do that instead of forming a mess it forma a very beautiful structure of inverted triangles till infinity.
                    
                    
                    *
                    
                    
                    
                    
                       [.]
                    
                    
 *                                 *

here the . inside [] is the random point and * these are the veritices of the triangle.
thus we then choose any vertice and just start dotting the plain to get something more like this:

       * 
      * * 
     *   * 
    * * * * 
   *       * 
  * *     * * 
 *   *   *   * 
* * * * * * * *
